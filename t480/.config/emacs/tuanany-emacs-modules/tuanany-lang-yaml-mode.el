;; In summary,
;; [-] :custom is used for setting variables and faces associated with
;; the package, before package loaded; while
;; [-] :config is used for executing Emacs Lisp code to configure or
;; initialize the package after it is loaded.
;; You can use both keywords together in a use-package declaration to
;; fully customize and configure a package to suit your needs.

;;;; Code:

(use-package yaml-mode
  :ensure t
  :mode (("\\.yml\\'" . yaml-mode)
         ("\\.yaml\\'" . yaml-mode)
         ("\\.gitlab-ci.yml\\'" . yaml-mode))

  :config
  (setq yaml-indent-offset 2)
  ;; :custom
  :hook
  (yaml-mode . display-line-numbers-mode)
  (yaml-mode . outline-indent-minor-mode)
  )
